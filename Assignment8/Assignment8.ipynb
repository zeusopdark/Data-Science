    "Cause: Syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code's structure, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or mismatched parentheses. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during program execution and are caused by runtime conditions, such as invalid input, division by zero, or accessing a non-existent file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage, before the code is executed. They prevent the code from running and must be fixed before execution. Exceptions are detected during runtime, while the code is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the code structure. Exceptions, however, can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully respond to errors, take alternative actions, or provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Python provides numerous built-in exception classes, such as ValueError, TypeError, FileNotFoundError, etc., to handle specific types of errors during runtime. Syntax errors do not have specific exception classes associated with them, as they are general mistakes in the code's syntax."
