    "In Python, we can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or constructors.\n",

    "    \n",
    "1-> Integer Conversion: To convert a value to an integer, we can use the int() function.\n",
    "It will remove any fractional part and return the integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: x = int(3.14)  # x will be 3\n",
    "y = int(\"10\")  # y will be 10\n",

    "2-> Floating-Point Conversion: To convert a value to a floating-point number, we can use the float() function.\n",
    "It will add a fractional part if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: x = float(5)     # x will be 5.0\n",
    "y = float(\"3.14\")  # y will be 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "3->String Conversion: To convert a value to a string, we can use the str() function.\n",

    "For example: x = str(10)     # x will be the string \"10\"\n",
    "y = str(3.14)   # y will be the string \"3.14\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4-> List Conversion: To convert a sequence (such as a string or a tuple) to a list, we can use the list() function.\n",
    "It will create a new list with the elements from the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: x = list(\"hello\")         # x will be ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "y = list((1, 2, 3, 4))    # y will be [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "\n",
    "For example: x = tuple(\"hello\")         # x will be ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')\n",
