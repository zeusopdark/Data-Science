    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods within a class,\n",
    "hiding the internal details and providing a public interface for interacting with the object. \n",
    "It allows for data abstraction and ensures that the internal state of an object can be accessed \n",
    "and modified only through well-defined methods, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance : Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes), allowing the derived classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from their parent classes. It promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the concept of \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class is a specialized version of its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism : Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It involves the ability to use a single interface (method or function) to represent different forms or behaviors. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (inherited methods with different implementations in derived classes) and method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction : Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features and behavior of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows for creating abstract classes and interfaces that define common characteristics and methods that subclasses must implement. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, providing a clear separation between the interface and implementation, and facilitating code maintenance and extensibility.\n",

    "These four pillars of OOP provide principles and techniques for designing and organizing code in a modular, reusable, and efficient manner, promoting code readability, maintainability, and scalability.\n"
